cytotools
=========

`cytotools` provides commandline tools for processing morphological profiling datasets. Most of the functionality is provided using `cytominer`.

`cytotools` is the new home for <https://github.com/broadinstitute/cytominer_scripts>. This will involve rewriting those scripts to make this into a real package.
